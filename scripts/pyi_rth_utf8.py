"""
PyInstaller Runtime Hook - Force UTF-8 encoding for stdout/stderr

This file is executed by PyInstaller BEFORE the main script,
at the earliest possible moment, ensuring UTF-8 encoding is set
for I/O streams.

IMPORTANT: UTF-8 mode is enabled via build-time OPTIONS in autoglm.spec:
    [('X utf8_mode=1', None, 'OPTION')]

This hook only handles stdout/stderr reconfiguration for extra safety.
